Source for my personal website hosted at https://akashmjn.me

This was created using:
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/): which is an abstraction to [easily manage HTML/CSS code](https://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/) so that content can be created in simple Markdown files. See [walkthrough](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) for details.
- [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes): which contains convenient pre-made Jekyll themes & layouts.
