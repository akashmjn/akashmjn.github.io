👋 Hi, I’m Akash, an applied researcher/engineer with experience in speech, audio (at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/cognitive-services-research/speech/)), and most recently multi-modal document understanding and retrieval (at [Contextual AI](https://contextual.ai/)). Turns out this completes the trio of audio, vision & text AI multimodality. :)

I’m currently on a brief sabbatical, exploring ideas & tinkering as I work out what’s next. Currently exploring real-time, on-device neural audio in the context of music and voice.

<div markdown="1">
* 0→1: Built the core multimodal document understanding system (parsing, representation and ingestion) powering retrieval in the company's context platform for agents (i.e. RAG).
* Applied research: Vision models, VLM workflow/agent framework, document representation for agentic retrieval (demo below).
* Tech Lead / Manager: Mentored, managed, interviewed candidates, DRI with forward-deployed eng, marketing, PM.
