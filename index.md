<!-- neural network whisperer / product minded AI / pulse on AI zeitgeist / love for X -->

👋. I'm currently working on meeting transcription as a Sr. Applied Scientist at Microsoft. I'm part of an R&D team responsible for shipping state-of-art speech recognition models for the Azure Cognitive Service (used by [Twitter](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1533249396837116946-twitter-media-entertainment-azure)) or to power new MSFT products such as [AI-assisted recap of meetings in Teams](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/12/23400332/microsoft-teams-premium-intelligent-recap-live-translations). In this role I need to deeply understand product needs & system limitations, keep a pulse on fast-evolving AI research while making prudent technology choices, implement these ideas and keep experimenting using data & distributed training infrastructure until we can ship better models.

🐋 In my first year at the [MSFT hackathon](https://news.microsoft.com/life/hackathon/) as an ode to the stunning beauty of the PNW region, I co-founded OrcaHello. OrcaHello is an [open-source](https://github.com/orcasound/aifororcas-livesystem) AI-assisted Southern Resident Killer Whale (SRKW) acoustic monitoring & alert system. Since it went live in September 2020, it's been "listening" 24x7 to [3 hydrophones](https://www.orcasound.net/) deployed in the Puget Sound and has issued expert-validated alerts to authorities like the [Port of Seattle](https://quietsound.org/). 

<!-- I've written about this incredible experience here. -->

I entered the code world ~7yrs ago with an unconventional career arc from a past life as a Chemical & Control Systems Engineer. Connecting the dots so far is a firm belief in my [ability to learn](https://twitter.com/ValaAfshar/status/1022297136300531713?s=20&t=SXYHzOC-ezEUx2Ea_CJ50Q), [product-minded](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/) instincts to bridge worlds and a hunger to make meaningful magic.
