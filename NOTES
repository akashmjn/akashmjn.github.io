        `bundle exec jekyll serve`


INFO:
* waves JS animation canvas:
    implemented as an imported js script under assets/js/plugins/waves.js
    this hyrates a <canvas> element added by _layouts/archive.html and _includes/page__hero_canvas.html
    on JS updates, needs to be recompiled manually into `main.min.js` using `npm run build:js`
    then regular `bundle exec jekyll serve` will pick up the changes
* analytics:
    * (July 1 2024) universal analytics property was auto migrated to GA4
    * (Nov 1 2025) updated to use gtag.js not analytics.js
    * (Nov 1 2025) google search property added for akashmjn.me
    * (Nov 1 2025) looked at cloudflare, only 30 day history, gotta stick it out w google, sadness
    * most imp concerns:
        update site code/tags so tracking happens properly
        update console reports/alerts (questions: for real user visits, when, where does it come from, what is visted)
* Info on Github pages and Jekyll
    https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll
* Custom domain was setup as below (just adding CNAME file not sufficient) 
    https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain
* Build/deployment process is setup to "publish from branch"
    https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-from-a-branch
    (seems to run some default jekyll build process, but can't find the yaml for it)
