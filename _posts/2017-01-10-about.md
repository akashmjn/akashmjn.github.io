Hi, I'm Akash. 

I'm currently a Masters student at Stanford in the department of Management Science and Engineering (MS&E) studying data science and business, and will be graduating in 2018. 

Prior to this I had a fun one year working at Ather Energy in Bangalore, India where I conceptualised and developed prototypes for Vehicle Intelligence features as one of the initial Data Scientists on the team.

I'm excited about work at the intersection of data and interesting products, and am on the look out for internship opportunities in the same.
