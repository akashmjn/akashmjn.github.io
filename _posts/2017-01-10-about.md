Hi, I'm Akash. 

I'm currently a Masters student at Stanford in the department of Management Science and Engineering (MS&E) studying CS, data science, and broadening my perspective on business concepts. I will be graduating in 2018. 

Prior to this I had a fun one year working at Ather Energy in Bangalore, India where I conceptualised and developed prototypes for Vehicle Intelligence features as one of the initial Data Scientists on the team.

I'm excited about work at the intersection of data, design and product, and am looking for interesting projects to collaborate on. Do hit me up for a quick chat if interested!
