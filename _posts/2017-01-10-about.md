Hi! I'm a 2nd year Masters student at Stanford's [MS&E](https://msande.stanford.edu) department, graduating in June 2018. At Stanford, through technical electives I've built my CS foundations, gotten deeper (excuse the pun) into stats, machine learning and NLP, and studied a breadth in digital signal processing - that I've been interested since my undergraduate at IIT Madras in ChemE and Control Systems Engineering. 

For a year prior to Stanford - I had a great time working at a couple of amazing startups in Bangalore; [Ather Energy](https://akashmjn.github.io/workprojects/atherenergy/) (1 year - early data scientist, misc. development and feature prototypes for smart electric scooters from sensor data) and [Predible Health](https://akashmjn.github.io/workprojects/predible/) (2 months - deep learning for ECG annotation). 

For my next opportunity, I'm interested in audio/signal processing applications of machine learning. Do reach out at [akashmjn] [at] [stanford] [dot] [edu] !
