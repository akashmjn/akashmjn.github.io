### Independent Research

I'm currently working with [Prof. Kathleen Eisenhardt](https://profiles.stanford.edu/kathleen-eisenhardt), taking forward some of this work for a more in-depth study of the music streaming industry involving Pandora, Rhapsody etc. looking at the evolution of this complex competitive space, different factors that come into play when dealing with the monopoly of music labels. A quick overview of 3 more detailed 5000 word case studies I had written on the same is below. Feel free to contact me if you'd like to learn more :)

### Strategy Course

The above work was a follow up on my project for the class MS&E 270 - Strategy in Technology Based Companies. Our team studied the strategy of Spotify and looked at future recommendations. We wrote a 30-page report, collecting information from interviews we conducted, and sourced from various press releases and industry reports on the evolution of the music streaming industry - with a focus on Spotify. A quick reference of our presentation below.
