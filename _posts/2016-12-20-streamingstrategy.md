### Strategy Course

For the class MS&E 270 - Strategy in Technology Based Companies, our team studied the strategy of Spotify and looked at future recommendations. We wrote a 30-page report, collecting information from interviews we conducted, and sourced from various press releases and industry reports on the evolution of the music streaming industry - with a focus on Spotify. A quick reference of our presentation below.

### Independent Research

I'm currently working with [Prof. Kathleen Eisenhardt](https://profiles.stanford.edu/kathleen-eisenhardt), taking forward some of this work for a more in-depth study of the music streaming industry involving other companies in this very competitive space.
