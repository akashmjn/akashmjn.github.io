### Spotify Strategy Analysis (MS&E270) 
*Playing a new tune in a disrupted market*

This work was done as a class project at Stanford for [MS&E 270: Strategy in Technology Based Companies](https://edusalsa.com/course?c=MS%26E%20270). Our team analyzed the competitive environment of the music industry,  studied the strategy of Spotify through a few different strategic frameworks (for e.g. VRIN), and then took a shot at future recommendations. This culminated in a 30-page report, collecting information from various press releases, interviews we conducted, and industry reports on the evolution of the music & streaming industry. You can skim through the summary presentation below.

### Independent Study & Case Writing 

I had followed up on this work as an independent study for credit under [Prof. Kathleen Eisenhardt](https://profiles.stanford.edu/kathleen-eisenhardt). The analysis was taken forward with a more in-depth breakdown of the fiendishly complex music industry, as well as a detailed look at Pandora's history as an older player in the same space. This concluded with a contrast between these two companies, in the form of 5000 word attempted-HBR-style ðŸ˜‰ case studies. 

Needless to say, I learnt a lot during this! Fun fact: early on in it's roughest times, Pandora's founder was rejected [350 times in pitches to venture capitalists](https://www.inc.com/magazine/20071001/pandoras-long-strange-trip.html). Feel free to contact me via email/twitter if you found this of interest, or would like to learn more! I can look into sharing/publishing those reports if needed.
